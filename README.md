# Horiseon : Code Refactor Challenge

#### The goal for this challenge was to take existing code for the Horiseon home page and refactor it to meet accessibility standards, add semantic html, consolidate and re-organize the CSS to follow the structure of the html elements, correct non-functioning links, and add comments to clarify the structure of the code.

## What You'll Find
* **Semantic HTML:** Updated generic containers to more appropriately describe the container elements.
* **Img Alt Attributes:** Added alt attributes to images in order to meet accessibility standards.
* **Heading Attributes:** Updated heading attributes to fall in sequential order. 
* **Concise Title:** Updated title element to better convey page content, improve accessibility and SEO.

## Built With
